# My Python Projects

This repository contains several Python projects that demonstrate various concepts and techniques. Each project is described in detail below.

## Projects

### 1. Caesar Cipher Using Python

A basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher used in cryptography. This project includes encryption and decryption functions and demonstrates how the Caesar Cipher works.

**Features:**
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher
- Customize the shift value for the cipher

**Usage:**
To use the Caesar Cipher, run the script and follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.

### 2. Password Complexity Checker

This project is a password complexity checker that evaluates the strength and health of passwords based on NIST guidelines. The checker provides feedback to users to help them create strong passwords.

**Features:**
- Minimum length requirement based on NIST guidelines
- Checks for uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Provides feedback on password strength and health
- Visual indicator for password strength

**Usage:**
Run the script and enter a password when prompted. The checker will evaluate the password's strength and provide feedback.

### 3. Keylogger

A keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Ethical considerations and permission are crucial for this project, and it is intended for educational use only.

**Features:**
- Record and log keystrokes
- Store logged keystrokes in a file
- Ethical considerations and user permission

**Usage:**
Run the script with appropriate permissions and follow ethical guidelines. The keylogger will log keystrokes and store them in a file.

### 4. Network Packet Analyzer

A network packet analyzer that captures and analyzes network packets. This project displays source IP, destination IP, payload, and other relevant information. Ethical considerations and permission are crucial, and it is intended for educational purposes only.

**Features:**
- Capture and analyze network packets
- Display source IP, destination IP, and payload
- Ethical considerations and user permission

**Usage:**
Run the script with appropriate permissions and follow ethical guidelines. The network packet analyzer will capture and display network packet information.

## Additional Libraries

The following additional libraries are used in these projects:

- **cryptography**: Provides the Fernet module for AES encryption and decryption.
- **logging**: Used for logging encryption and decryption operations with rotation.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
``bash
pip install cryptography
