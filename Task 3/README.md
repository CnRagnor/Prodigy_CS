# Educational Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project implements an ethical keylogger for educational and research purposes. The keylogger is designed with transparency and user consent as primary features, making it suitable for legitimate educational projects and internships.

## ⚠️ Important Notice
This tool is strictly for educational purposes. Users must:
- Obtain explicit consent before logging any keystrokes
- Follow local laws and regulations regarding data collection
- Use this tool only for legitimate educational/research purposes
- Never deploy this tool for malicious purposes

## Features
- Explicit user consent requirement
- Real-time keystroke logging with timestamps
- Emergency stop functionality (ESC key)
- Transparent logging process with visual feedback
- Secure log file creation with timestamps
- Clean program termination

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pynput library
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/educational-keylogger.git
cd educational-keylogger
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pynput
```

## Usage
1. Run the program:
```bash
python keylogger.py
```

2. Follow the consent prompt
3. Once consent is given, the program will:
   - Create a timestamped log file
   - Begin recording keystrokes
   - Display logging activity in the console
4. Press ESC at any time to stop logging

## Key Components
- `EthicalKeylogger` class: Main implementation
- Consent management system
- Logging configuration
- Keyboard event handling
- Safe termination procedures

## Log File Format
Logs are saved with timestamps:
```
2025-02-13 14:30:45: Key pressed: 'a'
2025-02-13 14:30:46: Key pressed: 'b'
```

## Ethical Guidelines
1. Always obtain written consent
2. Inform users about:
   - What data is being collected
   - How data will be stored
   - How data will be used
   - How to stop the logging
3. Store data securely
4. Delete logs after project completion
5. Never use for unauthorized monitoring

## Security Considerations
- Logs are stored locally
- No network transmission
- Clear visual indicators when logging is active
- Easy termination option
- Consent required for each session

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
1. Code follows ethical guidelines
2. Features maintain transparency
3. User consent remains mandatory
4. Documentation is updated accordingly
